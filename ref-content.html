                            General of Infrastructure Financing (DJPI) commissioned us to develop a prototype of
                            low-income housing that meets the green building criteria outlined by PERMEN PUPR No.
                            21/2021 (emphasis on low cost, energy efficient, water saving, and eco-friendly materials).
                            As a team, we develop design with passive design features, this prototype reduces technical
                            barriers for low-income housing developer that want to adopt green building certification.
                            This program aims to increase access to green financing programs. This will directly
                            facilitate the development of environmentally sustainable housing for low-income populations

                            in Jakarta. This project required multi-stakeholder collaboration as we work with teams from
                            various backgrounds. The activity was conducted through field measurements, data
                            verification and on-site observation to assess the performance of the building against
                            national green building policy (PERMEN PUPR No. 21/2021). We successfully delivered the
                            projects on schedule. The outcomes of these projects include assessment documents and energy
                            manager training programs, which will aid Jakarta in enhancing the performance of its public
                            buildings. In the future, more public buildings will be assessed, serving as role models for
