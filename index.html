            <p>As part of its efforts to accelerate green financing adoption in Indonesia, the Directorate General of Infrastructure Financing (DJPI) commissioned us to develop a prototype of low-income housing that meets the green building criteria outlined by PERMEN PUPR No. 21/2021 (emphasis on low cost, energy efficient, water saving, and eco-friendly materials). As a team, we develop design with passive design features, this prototype reduces technical barriers for low-income housing developer that want to adopt green building certification. This program aims to increase access to green financing programs. This will directly facilitate the development of environmentally sustainable housing for low-income populations in Indonesia.</p>

This project required multi-stakeholder collaboration as we work with teams from various backgrounds. The activity was conducted through field measurements, data verification and on-site observation to assess the performance of the building against national green building policy (PERMEN PUPR No. 21/2021). We successfully delivered the projects on schedule. The outcomes of these projects include assessment documents and energy manager training programs, which will aid Jakarta in enhancing the performance of its public buildings. In the future, more public buildings will be assessed, serving as role models for green building implementation in Jakarta.</p>
